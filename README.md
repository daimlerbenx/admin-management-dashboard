# Admin Management System

This project is a **dummy version** of an Admin Management System built using **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript**.

- **Sidebar Navigation**: Links to various sections like dashboard, orders, messages, and a logout option (non-functional).
- **Sales Analytics**: Static data for online/offline orders and new customers.
- **User Profile Section**: Includes a placeholder profile and dummy recent updates.
- **Theme Toggle**: Allows switching between light and dark modes.
- **Responsive Design**: Adaptable layout for different screen sizes.

## Technology Stack
